    "The programme consists of three classes that defines instances of students, courses and diploma programmes, named accordingly, at CBS as described in the given assignment text, as well as their related methods that defines their behaviour. The classes are described in detail in following cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "By design we have in addition to the suggested behaviour in the assignment text:\n",
    "* Students and courses have an automatically generated ID to distinguish the objects as they can have the same name. \n",
    "* Course objects that are not obligatory data science courses can exists and students can be enrolled in them. Only mandatory courses are considered when checking the status for pass/fail/distinction of the programme.  \n",
    "* Allow student objects to exist without being enrolled in all the mandatory courses. For students that are not enrolled in all mandatory courses, this is indicated as \"not eligible\" in the diploma status overview. \n",
    "* The code is scalable in terms of allowing different numbers of non-mandatory and mandatory courses and still gives the correct comparison for evaluating pass/fail/distinction of programme. \n",
    "* Testing is scalable since objects have been created dynamically in for-loops so that more courses and students can be generated, as well as the grade scenarios as it is iterated in cycles. Further, it has a class structure so it can easily be extended with testing modules like unittest or pytest. \n",

    "## DIPLOMA PROGRAMME CLASS\n",
    "\n",
    "The diplomma programme class creates programme instances. A programme is defined in regards to  which courses are mandatory and how many students who have passed/failed the diploma programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name used to access each specific instance of the class is the programme name. Furthermore, the instance also contain a list of mandatory courses and a dictionary of which students has passed, passed with distinction and failed. The list and the dictionaries are empty to begin with but by using the methods added to the class it is possible to add/remove courses as well as to update the diploma status and get a summary of it. Thus, 4 methods has been implemented in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add course method**: This method takes a course name as input. First, it checks whether the course name has not already been added to the course list. If it hasn't been added already then the course is added to the course list. Otherwise it'll print that the course name has already been added to the course list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remove course method**: This method also takes a course name as input. Opposite of the add_course method, this one checks if the course name already is in the list of courses. If it is, it removes the course from the list. If it's not in the course list it prints that the course is not in the programme. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Get diploma status method**: The diploma status method creates a dictionary listing the students that has passed, passed with distinction and failed the whole program. The function loops through all of the students in a list of all students. It refers to the STUDENT class and access the instances list from that class, which contains all students enrolled in the programme. Then two lists are created; one that keeps track of the students' diploma status and another that collects  number of passed courses for each student. Then the function checks if the student is enrolled in all of the mandatory courses. If the student is enrolled in all mandatory courses it loops through all courses in the course list and count the number of \"pass\" and append them to the list created earlier. Thus, there will be a list for each student containing the number of passed assignments. Then it checks if the amount of assingments passed in each course is equal to or greater than 3 as well as if the sum of the passed assignments in total is equal to or greater than 17. If this condition is true it'll be stated in the student diploma dict, that the student has passed with distinction. If it isn't true, it checks if the student has passed at least 3 assignments in each course. If that condition is true, the student will appear as passed in the student diploma dict. If none of the above conditions are true, the student will be added to the student diploma dict as failed. Lastly, the function returns the students diploma dict. Thus, when the function is called it'll return a dictionary stating which students has passed with distinction, passed and failed, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Get grade summary method**: This method returns a string that summarizes how many students passed with distinction, passed and failed, respectively. For each diploma status dictionary comprehension is used to summarize all values for the key in the students diploma dictionary that was created in the get diploma status function. The summarized value is saved in a variable (each for one of the possible diploma statuses) and then the values of these variables are returned in a string."

The dictionary holds ony unique keys which is useful to avoid duplicates which are allowed in lists and faster look-up times. If the student is already added in the dictionary, an explanatory string is printed. We chose to not do raise or asserts since the outcome is still as expected - if the student is not added it remains in the list - so we do not consider it important enough to stop the execution. This also applies for the remove_student() method. \n",

Since lists are zero-indexed then it should be the element at assignment number minus 1. Further, the make_transcript method defined in the Student class is called with the course name, to make sure that the current transcript is updated. Otherwise it returns an error message. Assert statements makes sure that the arguments given for assignment number is btween 1-5 to avoid index errors and status is either pass or fail strings as this is necessary for the list count function to work in get_diploma method in DiplomaProgramme class.
