    <td><strong>Please make sure that your name and email address have been set up correctly</strong> for <code>git</code>. This is very important, since otherwise you will not receive emails about the correctness of your code (and we cannot see who is who). See the "Github, git and the weekly hand-ins" page for details.

A large part of this first handin is to set everything up. The Python exercise itself is therefore quite short this week:

<ol>
<li>Write python code that opens the <code>alice.txt</code> file (provided in the repository), and reads the file into a list variable called <code>lines</code> where each element in the list corresponds to a line in the file.

To make sure that everything is set up correctly - try to run the unit tests (using the instructions in the Absalon assignment description). You should have 4 out of 5 errors. When that works, try to commit & push to the server. You should now receive an email with the same error report.</li>
<li>Calculate and print how many lines there are in the file.</li>
<li>Print the 41st line.</li>
<li>Count the number of words in the 43rd line and print the result.</li>
<li>Open a new file called <code>junk.txt</code>, saving it to a variable called <code>junk_file</code>. Use the writelines method to write the 9th to the 11th line (both included) from the <code>alice.txt.txt</code> file to this file. Remember to close the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
